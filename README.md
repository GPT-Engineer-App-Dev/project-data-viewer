# project-data-viewer

I want you to create an internal tool that allows user to upload a csv file containg data about projects and a series of edits. Here is an example of the data.

User should be able to:
-  select (dropdown) and filter by project ID (the first id in the path) and then see all the code edits in order of creation
- each edit, should show the code blocks with pretty print
- each edit (if status is not failed) should also diplay the commit sha

Here is an example of the first rows of the CSV:

__path__	__id__	__created__	__updated__	code_blocks	commit_sha	created_at	created_by	error_message	error_type	id	messages	num_of_edits	number	prompt	response	revert_target_edit_id	reverted	screenshot_url	status	tags	type

To implement this internal tool, I will:
1. Create a form to allow uploading a CSV file 
2. Parse the CSV data and store it in state
3. Add a dropdown to select a project ID
4. Display the edits for the selected project, showing the code blocks, commit SHA, and other metadata
5. Use Chakra UI components for the layout and styling

Implement an internal tool for viewing project data from a CSV file, with the following features:

- A form to upload a CSV file
- Parse the CSV data and store it in component state 
- Add a dropdown to select a project ID. Populate it with the unique project IDs from the CSV data
- When a project is selected, display a list of all the edits for that project, in order of creation
- For each edit, display:
  - The code blocks (if present), with syntax highlighting 
  - The commit SHA (if status is not failed)
  - The created at timestamp 
  - The edit ID
- Allow each edit's code block to be expanded/collapsed
- Use Chakra UI components for the layout and form elements

You can use this CSV data for testing:

__path__,__id__,__created__,__updated__,code_blocks,commit_sha,created_at,created_by,error_message,error_type,id,messages,num_of_edits,number,prompt,response,revert_target_edit_id,reverted,screenshot_url,status,tags,type

I'm working on implementing the internal tool to view project data from a CSV file. It will have a form to upload the CSV, a dropdown to select a project, and will display the edits for the selected project.

I'll let you know once I have the first version ready for you to try out.

The first version of the project data viewer is ready! You should see it in the GPT Engineer UI now.

It has a form where you can upload a CSV file containing the project data. Once uploaded, you can select a project ID from the dropdown to view all the edits for that project.

Each edit shows the code blocks (if any), commit SHA, creation timestamp, and edit ID. The code blocks can be expanded/collapsed.

Let me know if you have any feedback or additional requirements!
For the code part rely on the content of output attrobute inside the json contained in tags

Okay, so instead of using the code_blocks column directly, I need to parse the JSON in the tags column and use the output attribute from that for displaying the code.
